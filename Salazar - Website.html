Riot Games sure made great skins but here's the top 5 
League of Legends' best skin <FONT COLOR="black">lines</FONT></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"><FONT SIZE="20"> 5. Pool Party Skin Line</FONT><p>
<p><img src="Pool Party.png" width="900" height="535"><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"></p><p style="text-align:right;">
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT SIZE="6"><mark>This skin line is very good, Pool Party Renekton, Pool Party Sett, Pool Party Caitlyn, Pool Party Lee Sin and Pool Party Braum are probably the best skins on this skin line. The newest skins on this skin line are Pool Party Braum and Pool Party Sett. The newest skins were released on Thursday, June 10, 2021.</mark></FONT></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="white"><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"><FONT SIZE="20">4. Spirit Blossom Skin Line</FONT></p>
<p><img src="Spirit Blossom.jpg" width="900" height="535">
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT SIZE="6"><mark> Probably the skin everybody liked, good lore, good design and everyone seemed to like Spirit Blossom Yasuo, Spirit Blossom Yone and Spirit Blossom Yone and I kinda understand it well... The girls liked them three so... The latest skins were released on August 6, 2020.</mark></FONT></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"><FONT SIZE="20"> 3. Sentinels of Light and Ruined Skin Lines</FONT></p>
<img src="Sentinels of Light.jpg" width="900" height="535">
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT SIZE="6"><mark> These skins are good in terms of visual effects, recall and so on but on the other side, these skin lines broke the lore or kinda ruined it and many fans were disappointed at the event just because it ruined the lore but I could'nt disagree though. Sentinels of Light Vayne and Ruined Shyvanna are probably the best one out there. July 9, 2021.</FONT></mark></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="Black"><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"><FONT SIZE="20">2. True Damage Skin Line</FONT></p>
<img src="True Damage.jpg" width="900" height="535">
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT SIZE="6"><mark> Best skins, best music. Riot games has made several music group like K/DA, Pentakill and their several songs, BUT TRUE DAMAGE, it stands out for me because Thutmose was a decent rapper, fast as Eminem but Eminem is still faster and I was kinda surprised Soyeon was still voice acting Akali on true damage. True Damage Ekko and True Damage Yasuo are the best in my opinion. This skin line was released on November 10, 2019.</FONT></mark></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="white"><FONT FACE="Friz Quadrata"><FONT SIZE="20"> 1. PROJECT Skin line</FONT></p>
<img src="PROJECT.jpg" width="900" height="535">
<p><FONT COLOR="black"><FONT SIZE="6"><mark>THIS ONE, THIS SKIN. This skin is THE BEST running skin line since 2014 in my opinion. Just look how amazing the splash arts are and by far the best, even though I still don't know what their lore is, it's still the best skin line in my opinion and considering some skin on this skin line was released on 2014. The best skin I can recommend is PROJECT: Mordekaiser, it melts yur ancient pc. Latest skin was released on Thursday, May 27, 2021 and the oldest were released somewhere in 2014.</mark></FONT></p>
